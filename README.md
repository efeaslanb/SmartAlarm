# Smart Alarm Clock System  

A remote-controlled Arduino alarm clock with an LCD timer, brightness control via potentiometer, and dual buzzer/LED alerts. The enclosure was designed in Fusion 360 and 3D printed.  

**How it Works:**  
- LCD timer with remote input through IR receiver  
- Adjustable display brightness with a potentiometer  
- Buzzer + LED signals for clear alarm alerts  

**Results:**  
- Remote operation up to 10 meters  
- Runs in Arduino C++ when powered by USB or outlet adapter  
- Compact, custom 3D-printed enclosure
